# hello-world

I'm learning how to use git.


## Stuff I Learned So Far

1. go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and created a new repository
2. then `git clone git@github.com:my-username/my-project-name` to copy the project to my computer
3. i like using atom, so i open my repository with `atom my-project-name`
4. after i make changes, i _add_ them with `git add file1 file2 file3`
5. when everything i want to change is added, i commit them with `git commit -m "info about my changes"`
6. then i push the changes back to github with `git push origin master`
